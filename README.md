# CriminalIntent Android App
Full disclosure: this app was constructed by following along with the Big Nerd Ranch Android Programming book. I wrote out all of the lines of code and fully understand them; however most lines are from the textbook. 

I put this here to show what I was working on in the Summer of 2018. This is not the only app I completed; it is, however, the most extensive one. This particular app took over 250 pages of the textbook to complete.

## The Idea
It's a tongue-in-cheek app for keeping track of "office crimes." For instance, things like someone stealing your yogurt out of the breakroom fridge. While it's a silly idea, it did provide lots of opportunity to explore the basics of android app development, including:
* Various types of Fragments and Activities, which are the basic units used to build and control Android views
* RecyclerViews, DatePickers, Dialogs, ViewPagers
* Launching activities that are outside of the current app (ex. taking a picture, choosing a contact from the user's contacts, and sending a "crime report" using the users app of choice
* The Model-View-Controller app development paradigm
* Using drawable resources

Here is an idea of what the finished product looks like:

(Default screen - shows a list of crimes. Use '+' to add a new crime)

(After tapping on a crime - shows its details, allowing you to take a picture, change date, choose suspect)

(Demonstrating the "Send Report" feature, which allows user to send report as a text or email using external app)
